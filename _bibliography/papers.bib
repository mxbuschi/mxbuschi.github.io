abstract = {Conventional industrial robots are increasingly used for milling applications of large workpieces due to their workspace and their low investment costs in comparison to conventional machine tools. However, static deflections and dynamic instabilities during the milling process limit the efficiency and productivity of such robot-based milling systems. Since the pose-dependent dynamic properties of the industrial robot structures are notoriously difficult to model analytically, machine learning methods are recently gaining more and more popularity to derive system models from experimental data. In this publication, a modeling concept based on a modern information fusion scheme, fusing simulation and experimental data, is proposed. This approach provides a precise model of the robot's pose-dependent structural dynamics and is validated for a one-dimensional variation of the robot pose. The results of two information fusion algorithms are compared with a conventional, data-driven approach and indicate a superior model accuracy regarding interpolation and extrapolation of the pose-dependent dynamics. The proposed approach enables decreasing the necessary amount of experimental data needed to assess the vibrational properties of the robot for a desired pose. Additionally, the concept is able to predict the robot dynamics at poses where experimental data is very costly to gather.},

@article{Busch2021,
abstract = {In the course of the digitization of modern production systems, a reliable parameterization of the digital twin of machining processes is essential. For example, the digital representation of milling operations enables the process parameter selection without time-consuming and expensive test series by using stability lobe diagrams (SLD). However, the parameterization of the underlying process force model with very few cutting force experiments can prevent a reliable process design, as errors in the parameterization process are propagated to the stability analysis. Therefore, a novel two-step methodology is proposed to provide probabilistic credible intervals for conventional stability lobe diagrams: First, the unknown parameters of the process force model are estimated using a Bayesian regression method. Secondly, the estimated probability distributions of the process force parameters are used to quantify the uncertainty of the stability boundary using a mechanistic process force model. The proposed methodology is particularly characterized by its low computational cost, since time-consuming and computationally expensive Monte Carlo procedures are avoided. Instead, the methodology relies on the analytical derivation of the model parameters' posterior probability distribution and on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) algorithms to quantify the uncertainty in the final stability analysis.},

@article{Schmucker2021,
abstract = {The comparison between measured and simulated machining forces enables the evaluation of workpiece quality, process stability, and tool wear condition. To compute the machining forces that occur, mechanistic cutting force models are typically used. The cutting force coefficients (CFCs) of mechanistic force models are directly linked to the mechanics of chip formation and, thus, depend on the tool-workpiece combination and on the prevailing cutting conditions. CFCs are usually identified via the average cutting force identification method, which requires the execution of cutting tests under defined test conditions. Hence, determining CFCs for different cutting conditions is time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, the performance of an instantaneous CFC identification approach based on Bayesian Optimization during the machining of arbitrary workpiece geometries is studied. Bayesian Optimization is well suited for global optimization problems with computationally expensive cost functions. The simulated cutting forces are calculated using a dexel-based cutter workpiece engagement simulation and the actual cutting forces are measured during the machining process using a dynamometer. Thus, an efficient identification of CFCs could be achieved.},

abstract = {The ongoing transformation of the manufacturing landscape introduces new business opportunities for enterprises but also brings new challenges with it. Especially small-and medium-sized companies (SMEs) require an increasing effort to stay competitive. Data produced on the shop-floor can be harnessed to conduct analyses useful to plant operators, e.g., for optimization of production capabilities or for increasing plant security. Therefore, we propose a privacy-preserving edge-computing architecture to facilitate a platform for utilizing such applications. Our approach is motivated by requirements from SMEs in Germany, e.g., protection of intellectual property, and employs suitable privacy models. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework by evaluation of uses cases for machine chatter optimization and anomaly detection within plants.},
